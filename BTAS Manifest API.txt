my own web hosting: http://10.214.176.6/api/manifest

User can access the manifest thru the app or directly.
Once token was received, they can proceed with the manifest.

Request will pass the APIKEY and APITOKEN in Header for verification

Request format:
{
  "shipperId": "AUSTSYD",
  "carrier": "BORDEDI",
  "consignmentId": [
    "123",
    "323",
    "323"
  ]
}

ShipperID and Carrier will be used to validate that the requests matches records in the database.
-- The shipperId needs to be used to check that those consignmentId belongs to that shipper
-- Then the carrier we need to check that the shipments belong to that carry and that is who we are going to send the manifest too 

If everything is valid, create the Manifest XML and save to Manifest table.
ManifestId will be updated to the tbl_carrier_api_response table tbl_carrier_api_manifestId

Tables To Look For:
1A. tbl_barcodes.tbl_barcodes_shipment_id = tbl_shippers_tracking_ref.tbl_shippers_tracking_shipmentId = tbl_parcel_info.idtbl_parcel_info = 
tbl_parcel_items.tbl_parcel_items_info_id = tbl_carrier_api_response.tbl_carrier_api_response_parcelId

1B. tbl_barcodes.tbl_barcodes_parcel_id = tbl_parcel_items.idtbl_parcel_items

2. tbl_services.tbl_services_code = tbl_parcel_info.tbl_parcel_info_serviceCode
